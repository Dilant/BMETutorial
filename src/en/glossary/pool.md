# Pool

`07_Pool`

Named as `WP_axb`. `a` `b` refer to length and width, they don't distinguish with each other.

Properties:

- Fixed object.
- Paperball, iceball, rubberball and woodenball float on water. The buoyancy is related to gravity acceleration of the scene. _That is to say, there's no buoyancy in universe scene._
- The direction of buoyancy is always straight up, **which is irrelevant to the posture of the pool**. Don't place a pool upside down as a trap.
- Paperball loses durability rapidly when it meets water. Most turns into recoverable durability (the lighter bar), and the remaining part drains.
- Can be used to put out fire; also can be used to cool the ball in abyss scene.
- The wave affects buoyancy, but **don't make use of it**.

- There's a layer at the bottom of pool without buoyancy, but **don't make use of it**.

- When the ball is in two pools at the same time, **the latter loses buoyancy**. So don't place pools adjacently.
