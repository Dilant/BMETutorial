# Machinery Locating

The recommendation for beginners are:

- Try your best to align
- Avoid blocking or clipping
- Do not rotate any fixed-axis rigid body around `X` or `Z` axis
- Do not scale any fixed-axis rigid body.

Due to the irregular shape of and usually useless vertices on the machinery, most of them can only precisely pinpoint an axis or two, while a bit of eyeballing are required for the rest. (performing bisection on that specific coordinate). [Orthogonal view](/start/basic-operation.md#切换透视-正交视角) or [end view](/start/basic-operation.md#三视图) may come in handy.

No matter what, the most important thing to bear in mind is **making sure machinery is working correctly**!
