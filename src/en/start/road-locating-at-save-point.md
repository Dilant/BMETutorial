# Road Locating at Save Point

![](/images/road-at-savepoint-example.jpg)

Similar to [road locating at start point](/start/road-locating-at-start-point.md) taking one-unit-width road as an example, here we provide the corresponding schemes for reference.

## Concatenating Scheme

The save point in the header image is 1 grid length higher than the road. The road can penetrate the save point in this scheme.

## Inlaying Scheme

The save point in the header image is 0.65 grid length higher than the road. The road can be partially inlaid into the save point in this scheme.

## Gridding Scheme

The save point in the header image is 1 grid length higher than the road. The terminal is 4 grid length horizontally away from the save point.
