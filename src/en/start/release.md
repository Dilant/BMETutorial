## Export `.bms` File

`File → Export .bms File`

`.bms` files can be shared for others to play.

::: tip

If you want to upload it to Steam Workshop, continue reading.

Every player can play this map from now on, so [do comprehensive tests](/en/start/map-testing.md) and always pay attention to its quality!

:::

## Prepare a Cover

The cover should be in `.jpg` format, and recommended resolution is 1920×1080.

[Screenshots](/en/start/basic-operation.md#screenshot) from maptest mode meet this requirement. You can also draw it yourself, providing that it's relevant to the map topic. ~~No hamsters please~~

## Prepare Map Name and Description

Map name should be the same as [level info](/en/glossary/assets-in-menu.md#level-info). If possible, you can append its translation.

It's recommended that the description tells number of sections and map difficulty. Estimated time for first attempt, characteristics of map and other relevant information can be added. If possible, you can provide its translation.

_English only is okay, and we are encouraging Chinese mappers to translate everything into English if possible._

## Upload to Steam Workshop

`File → Upload to Workshop`

Choose the `.bms` map and the `.jpg` cover, fill in map name and description, and click `Upload`.

::: tip

There's no use pressing `Enter` in the textbox in BME, but you can write your words in notepad and paste them.

Check your internet connection before uploading maps, and use proxy if necessary. See also:
