# Release Map

## Export `.bms` File

`File → Export .bms File`

`.bms` files can be shared for others to play.

::: tip

You can unpack `.bms` files in BME 3.5.1b1 or newer versions.

If you want to upload it to Steam Workshop, continue reading.

Every player can play this map from now on, so do comprehensive [tests](/start/test-map.md) and always pay attention to its quality!

:::

## Prepare a Cover

The cover should be in `.jpg` format, and recommended resolution is 1920×1080.

[Screenshots](/en/start/basics.md#screenshot) from maptest mode meet this requirement. You can also draw it yourself, providing that it's relevant to the map topic. ~~No hamsters please~~

## Prepare Map Name and Description

Map name should be the same as [levelinfo](/glossary/assets-in-menu.md#地图信息). If possible, you can append its translation.

It's recommended that the description tells number of sections and map difficulty. Estimated time for first-seen pass, characteristics of map and other relavant information can be added. If possible, you can provide its translation.

_English only is OK, and we are encouraging Chinese mappers to translate everything into English if possible._

## Upload to Steam Workshop

`File → Upload to Workshop`

Choose the `.bms` map and the `.jpg` cover, fill in map name and description, and click `Upload`.

::: tip

There's no use pressing `Enter` in the textboxes in BME, but you can write your words in notepad and paste them.

Check your internet connection before uploading maps, and use proxy if necessary. See also:
