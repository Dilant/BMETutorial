# Machinery Locating

The recommendation for beginners are:

- Try your best to align
- Avoid blocking or clipping
- Do not rotate any fixed-axis rigid body around `X` or `Z` axis
- Do not scale any fixed-axis rigid body

Due to the irregular shape of and usually useless vertices on the machinery, most of them can only precisely pinpoint an axis or two, while a bit of eyeballing are required for the rest (to perform bisection on that specific coordinate). [Orthogonal view](/en/start/basic-operation.md#toggle-perspective-orthogonal-view) and [end view](/en/start/basic-operation.md#three-views) may come in handy.

No matter what, the most important thing to bear in mind is **making sure machinery is working correctly**!
