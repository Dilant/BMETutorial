# Migration Guide

::: tip

Starting from BME 3.5.3b2, the default project changes from `MyBallexMap` to `NewProject`. Assets and maps before and after this separation point will not interfere with each other. So, it's highly recommended to finish WIP maps in old BME.

If you still prefer editing these maps in new BME, follow these instructions.

:::

- Export every map in old BME, so you get `.bms` files
- For every `.bms` file, unpack, [re-add level info](/en/start/basic-operation.md#create-level-info) and save
- These maps still exist in old BME after migration. You can right-click to remove if you no longer need them
